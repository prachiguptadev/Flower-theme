  <h1>Flower</h1>
  <p>
    A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive
    structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division Angiospermae).
    Flowers produce gametophytes, which in flowering plants consist of a few
    haploid cells which produce gametes.

  <p>Self-pollination happens in flowers where the stamen and carpel mature at the same time, and are positioned so that
    the pollen can land on the flower's stigma. This pollination does not require an investment from the plant to
    provide nectar and pollen as food for pollinators.</p>
  <p>Most flowering plants depend on animals, such as bees, moths, and butterflies, to transfer their pollen between
    different flowers, and have evolved to attract these pollinators by various strategies, including brightly colored,
    conspicuous petals, attractive scents, and the production of nectar, a food source for pollinators.[2] In this way,
    many flowering plants have co-evolved with pollinators to be mutually dependent on services they provide to one
    anotherâ€”in the plant's case, a means of reproduction; in the pollinator's case, a source of food.[3] After
    fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds.</p>
